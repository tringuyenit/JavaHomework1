# myFirstJavaProg
This is my first Java program.

It is my practice about reading and writing text file.

The program stores information of users after creating accounts and logging in/out.

## How to run (from command lines)

1. In your cmd/terminal, navigate to :

```bash
myFirstJavaProg/out/production/IdeaProjects
```

2. Run the following command to execute the program :

```bash
java finalProject.view.Main
```

3. All data will be stored in :

```bash
myFirstJavaProg/src/finalProject/data
```

## Note

1. For those who don't know command lines,  
the program can be run by any Java IDE instead.

2. Password must be at least 8 characters long  
contain a number, an uppercase letter and a special character.

3. There is one default admin data stored in :

```bash
myFirstJavaProg/src/finalProject/data/admin.txt
```

4. The username and password for the default admin are :

```bash
boss
Boss123@
```
respectively.
